# Attribution — Everything Claude Code (ECC)

The seven `.md` files in this folder are skills extracted from the **Everything Claude Code (ECC)** open-source agent harness:

- **Project**: Everything Claude Code (ECC)
- **Author**: Affaan Mustafa
- **Repository**: <https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code>
- **License**: MIT (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) — copy of upstream license preserved)
- **Version vendored**: snapshot taken on 2026-04-25

## Why these are here

They're bundled in this repo as part of the author's **personal backup** — they're symlinked back into `~/.claude/skills/` by [`scripts/install.sh`](../../scripts/install.sh) when restoring on a new Mac.

They are **NOT** listed in [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](../../.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) and **cannot** be installed via `/plugin install` from this repo. Anyone who wants ECC should install it directly from upstream.
