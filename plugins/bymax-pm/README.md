# bymax-pm

Engineering Project Manager for multi-agent development. One Claude Code session —
the PM — coordinates independent Claude Code peer sessions across repositories:
structured task contracts, evidence-based completion, independent review, blocker
resolution, and a persistent board that survives restarts. The human talks to the
PM; the PM manages the system.

Built on Claude Code's native cross-session messaging (`ListAgents` /
`SendMessage`, including one-shot idle notifications). No daemon, no database, no
custom transport: state is markdown in `.claude/pm/`, evidence is git/GitHub.

## Install

```bash
# marketplace (once per machine, if not already added)
claude plugin marketplace add bymaxone/bymax-claude-code
claude plugin install bymax-pm@bymax-claude-code
```

Per-project instead of global: install it in the **coordination directory** — the
folder the PM session runs from (step 1 below), never a worker's repository — by
running the install there, or by copying `skills/pm/` into
`<coordination-dir>/.claude/skills/pm/` (project-level skills need no plugin).
Verify with `claude plugin list` and by typing `/bymax-pm:pm` in a session.

## Set up the topology

1. **Pick a coordination directory** for the PM — a workspace folder *above* your
   repositories (not inside a worker's repo), e.g. `~/work/acme-program/`. The PM
   creates `.claude/pm/` (board, task files, roster, decisions, activity log)
   there. Commit it to git if you want the board versioned — it contains no secrets.
2. **Start the PM session** there, with a name:

   ```bash
   cd ~/work/acme-program
   claude --name pm
   ```

   Then invoke `/bymax-pm:pm` (or just tell it to act as PM — the skill
   description lets Claude load it from natural language).
3. **Start each worker session** in its own terminal, in its own repo, with a
   meaningful name — the name is the address the PM delegates to:

   ```bash
   cd ~/work/nest-logger        && claude --name nest-logger
   cd ~/work/backend-template   && claude --name backend-template
   cd ~/work                    && claude --name reviewer
   ```

   Workers need nothing installed — the PM's messages carry their own reply
   instructions. An already-running unnamed session can join with `/rename <name>`.
4. **Talk to the PM.** Give it goals ("prepare nest-logger for the new
   observability package"), ask `status`, `standup`, or `release-check`. It
   discovers the workers with `ListAgents`, delegates, verifies, and reports.

## Resume after a restart

Start the PM the same way in the same directory (`claude --name pm`, or resume the
previous session) and invoke `/bymax-pm:pm`. The startup routine reloads
`.claude/pm/`, reconciles it against the repositories and the currently live
agents, re-subscribes idle notices, and continues — the board, not the previous
conversation, is the source of truth. Workers that died can be restarted under the
same names at any time.

## Requirements

- Claude Code with cross-session messaging (2.1.236+ for idle notifications).
- `git` always; `gh` authenticated wherever verification reads PRs or CI — Gate 3,
  startup reconciliation, and `release-check` depend on it. Without `gh` the PM must
  report those checks as unverifiable, never assume them green.
- Optional: Agent Teams (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`) if you want the
  PM to also spawn managed teammates; independent peer sessions work without it.

## What's inside

```
commands/pm.md                → /bymax-pm:pm [status|standup|release-check]
skills/pm/SKILL.md            → operating principles (the five laws, loop, boundaries)
skills/pm/references/
  peer-protocol.md            → discovery, message types, idle notices, stuck peers
  task-contract.md            → contract template, acks, risk & priority models
  lifecycle.md                → state machine, quality gates, evidence, release readiness
  escalation.md               → blockers, disagreements, decision log, human escalation
  reporting.md                → status / standup / release formats, health criteria
  persistence.md              → .claude/pm/ layout, startup, handoff, failover
  multi-repo.md               → dependency DAG, collisions, parallelization, Gate 5
  example.md                  → end-to-end worked scenario
```

Pairs naturally with the rest of the toolkit: workers can use
`/bymax-quality:code-review` as their review gate and `/bymax-pr:push` to ship —
the PM treats those as evidence like any other.
