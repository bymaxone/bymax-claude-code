# QA scope guard — PreToolUse hook for bymax-qa.
#
# Enforces the audit scope while an audit is running. It is inert unless the
# audit workspace marker `.claude/qa/.active` exists in the session's working
# directory — outside an audit it never blocks anything.
#
# While active, it is a FLOOR under two boundaries the /bymax-qa:audit skill
# relies on. A floor, not a sandbox: it catches the common slip, and the skill's
# "never edit the target" discipline plus read-only finder agents are the real
# control.
#   1. A network tool (curl, wget, nc, nmap, sqlmap, nuclei, zap, ffuf, openssl
#      -connect, ssh/scp, the qa-probe wrapper, ...) invoked in command position
#      may only reach a host listed under `allowed-hosts:` in .claude/qa/scope.md.
#      A command whose host cannot be resolved from its text is blocked too —
#      an unresolvable target cannot be checked against the allow-list. It does
#      not recognise every network-capable binary (a `python3 -c` one-liner, an
#      unlisted tool); those rest on the skill's discipline. The hook inspects
#      the COMMAND, not the ambient environment: a proxy set in the environment
#      (HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/ALL_PROXY) is invisible here, so run probes through
#      qa-probe (which passes `--noproxy '*'`) or keep no off-scope proxy in the
#      audit environment.
#   2. A Write/Edit/MultiEdit tool call may only land inside this project's
#      .claude/qa/. It does NOT police file writes made by an arbitrary Bash
#      command (`sed -i`, a `>` redirect, `rm`) — the hook cannot parse every
#      shell write, so "never edit the target" is enforced by the skill, and
#      this rule stops the common tool-based slip.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  → allow (not active, or allowed)
#   2  → block — Claude Code surfaces the JSON systemMessage to the user
#
# To disable, remove .claude/qa/.active (the skill does this when a run ends) or
# comment out the hook entry in the plugin's hooks.json.
