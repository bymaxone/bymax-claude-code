# codex-review.sh — optional independent second review via the Codex CLI.
#
# Runs a review against a scope the caller resolved and prints it verbatim. It is
# a SECOND OPINION, never a gate: the Bymax verdict is computed without it.
#
# Two modes, two different questions:
#   standard     `codex exec review` — is this change correct? Needs only the
#                `codex` binary.
#   adversarial  the openai-codex plugin's `adversarial-review` — is this the
#                right approach at all? Challenges design, tradeoffs and
#                assumptions rather than hunting implementation defects.
#
# The adversarial mode drives the openai-codex plugin's own runtime
# (`codex-companion.mjs`) instead of reimplementing it. That plugin marks
# `/codex:adversarial-review` as `disable-model-invocation: true`, so the slash
# command cannot be called from a skill — but the runtime underneath it is a
# plain Node script that locates its own prompts via `import.meta.url`, so it
# runs fine when invoked by absolute path. Reusing it means the adversarial
# prompt keeps tracking upstream instead of drifting in a copy here.
#
# On whether that is a bypass of upstream's boundary — answered here rather than
# left to be re-argued each round:
#   - `disable-model-invocation` gates the slash-command WRAPPER. The runtime
#     carries no such flag, and upstream's own `codex-rescue` subagent invokes
#     that same runtime (`task`) from an agent.
#   - What the flag protects is consent: a model must not start a billed Codex
#     run on its own. An earlier version of this comment claimed the calling
#     command supplied that consent because it is "user-only in this toolkit".
#     That was false and had never been checked — no Bymax command sets
#     `disable-model-invocation`, and fifteen files invoke the review command
#     from a model. The consent now lives where it can be enforced: the caller
#     passes `--mode adversarial` only when the user asked for it with the
#     `--adversarial` flag, which is off by default.
#   - What the flag cannot express is "this runtime is internal": that is the
#     version allowlist below, not the wrapper.
# If upstream publishes a supported invocation surface for the adversarial
# review, prefer it and delete this mode's direct call.
#
# The two modes are meant to be launched as two concurrent background shells by
# the caller, so they cost wall-clock only once.
#
# Contract (never violated):
#   - ALWAYS exits 0. A missing CLI, an expired session, a rate limit, a
#     timeout or a parse failure are all reported as status lines, never as
#     failures that could stall /bymax-quality:code-review.
#   - NEVER prompts, NEVER installs anything, NEVER writes to the repo. In
#     standard mode this script pins the sandbox and approval policy per
#     invocation (`-c sandbox_mode=read-only -c approval_policy=never`), so it
#     holds regardless of the user's Codex config. In adversarial mode the
#     guarantee is upstream's, not this script's: the plugin runtime starts its
#     review thread with a hardcoded `sandbox: "read-only"` and an
#     `approvalPolicy` defaulting to `"never"` (lib/codex.mjs), and the app-server
#     protocol takes no `-c` overrides for this script to add. Verified against
#     openai-codex 1.0.6 — a reader auditing this contract must re-check it
#     against the version `find_companion` actually resolves.
#   - First stdout line is always `CODEX_STATUS: <status>`, so the caller can
#     branch deterministically without interpreting prose.
#
# Statuses:
#   ok                 review ran over exactly the requested scope; report follows
#   ok-unpinned        review ran, but not over exactly the requested scope —
#                      adversarial past the runtime's inline-diff limit or on a
#                      dirty tree with a branch target, standard on a branch
#                      target with untracked files. Findings are reportable;
#                      silence is not evidence. A CODEX_SCOPE line says why.
#   absent             codex CLI is not installed
#   unauthenticated    no active Codex session (logged out or expired)
#   bad-invocation     a flag without its value, an unknown flag or --mode:
#                      the caller's command line is wrong, not the scope
#   unsupported-target the caller's scope cannot be expressed as a codex flag
#   timeout            the run exceeded --budget
#   failed             codex exited non-zero, or produced no usable output
#   adversarial-absent --mode adversarial, but the openai-codex plugin (or node)
#                      is not installed. Only this mode is affected.
#
# Usage:
#   codex-review.sh [--mode standard|adversarial] --target uncommitted [--budget <sec>]
#   codex-review.sh [--mode standard|adversarial] --target base --ref <branch> [--budget <sec>]
#   codex-review.sh --target commit --ref <sha> [--budget <sec>]   # standard only
#
# The adversarial runtime is resolved through `claude plugin list --json` — the
# installed, enabled plugin with id `codex@openai-codex`, and nothing else. Set
# BYMAX_CODEX_COMPANION to an explicit codex-companion.mjs path to override that
# (a project-local install, or a pinned version); the override is trusted as the
# user's own decision.
#
# Notes for the caller:
#   - `codex exec review` rejects custom instructions whenever a scope flag is
#     present, so this review is unsteered by design. That independence is the
#     point: it is what makes the second opinion worth having.
#   - The output is NOT deterministic. Two runs over the same commit return
#     overlapping but different findings. Treat it as sampling, not as a gate.

# `*/codex/*/scripts/codex-companion.mjs` and fell back to marketplace
# checkouts: any marketplace shipping a plugin named `codex`, installed or not,

# abandoned at the budget left `app-server-broker.mjs` and `codex app-server`

# it interrupts the Codex turn (which is what bills) and terminates that job's
# process tree, without killing the broker daemon, which is shared per workspace
# and may be serving another session's review.
#
# Three things about that cancel, each learned from a review of the previous
# version:
#   - It is bounded. It talks to the broker over a socket, and a hung broker is
#     exactly the case a timeout is handling; unbounded, it would block here
#     forever and `timeout` would never be emitted.
#   - Its exit status is not its verdict. The runtime exits 0 once it has
#     RESOLVED the job, even when the interrupt RPC failed and the turn is still
#     running. The `--json` payload's `turnInterrupted` is the fact that matters.
#   - A cancel that fails is reported, not swallowed, with the one command that
#     can still reach the run: `/codex:status` cannot show it (it filters by the
